## Progress Check / Stand Up
Each week, I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by including a **Stand-Up**. A "stand-up" is when I take the time to briefly report out on the following...

1. **Accomplishments** - What I worked on this past week
2. **Challenges** - Any challenges I may have (and how I am addressing those challenges)
3. **Next Steps** - What I plan to prioritize and do next 
   

<br>

**Week 1**: This last week I have challenged myself to familiarize myself with both Git and the terminal. Learning two new programs within the week has proved to be difficult and time consuming but I have stuck too it and continued to try until I prevailed. My plan of action for the future is to continue learning about Git and terminal until I can navigate through them with ease.

**Week 2**: Next Stand up... Milestone 2  

**Week 3**:    

**Week 4**:
