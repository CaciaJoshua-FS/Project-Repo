This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Terminal
Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential commands to know.**

List the correct Terminal commands to do the actions listed below. Replace **CMD** with the correct command sequence. You can keep or enhance the brief description. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* [ clear ]: Clear the Screen 
* [ pwd ]: Print the "Working Directory"
* [ ls ]: List files and folders
* [ ls -a ]: List files and folders, including invisible files
* [ ls -lh ]: List all files and folders, in human readable form
* [ cd[folder] ]: Change directory
* [ cd / ]: Change directory, go to root directory
* [ cd ]: Change directory and go to user home directory
* [ cd .. ]: Change directory, go up one folder level
* [ cd ../.. ]: Change directory, go up two folder levels
* **cd ~/Desktop/**: Change directory to my desktop! 


**2. Using Terminal...**

**Folder Drop:** Try typing "cd" followed by a space, and then drag a folder into terminal and press return. Test this out and describe your results below.  

[When using cd followed by a space and pressing return the file then registered that we are in the WDV folder. ]


## Topic: Version Control & Git
Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Update the information below where indicated.  

**1. There are three types of version control.**

[ The three types of version control include distibuted, local, and centralized]



**2. Using Terminal, there are also essential Git commands to know.**

List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description. **The last bullet provides an example**. 

* [ git clone [url]]: Clone a repository
* [ git config --global user.name [name] ]: Set-up a global user name
* [ git config --global user.email [email] ]: Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account eMail)
* git status : [ displays the state of the working directory and the staging area ]
* [ git add ]: Add modified files to the next commit
* [ git commit -m ]: Make a commit with a new message
* [ git log]: Show my commit history
* **git help**: This command will bring up Git's help screen in Terminal!
    



**3. Connecting to GitHub using Terminal.**
HTTPS is the the correct way to connect to GitHub in this course. Describe how you connect to GitHub from Terminal using this protocol. What steps do you take? 

[   cd desktop
    cd [file]
    ls
    pwd [file]
    git clone [link] ]



**4. Using .gitignore and Why it's Important**  
Most repositories contain a .gitignore file. 

* What is the purpose of this file?  
* What is the "**.DS_Store**" file and why would you want to ignore it?
* What other file or folder would you want to add to a .gitignore file and why? 


[The purpose of this file is too tell Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository.
The DS store or Desktop Service Store contains information about system configurations that if  uploaded along with other files, the files can be misused to obtain information about your computer. Another file you would like to add to your .gitignore is your README.md. ]

Replace the example references below with your own links and recommended resources. It is acceptable to provide multiple links for a single topic and to use material provided to you in this class. You are encouraged to link to your own independent research as well. 

[ This resources I believe helped me the most this week was the Git and Terminal cheat sheets which allowed me to learn more tricks while venturing through these programs.]
